# DEN408_manipulator
Simulation of a two-link planar anthropomorphic manipulator using Simulink
Aim: To investigate the factors governing the performance of a simple servo-controlled two link robot manipulator, and relate these to basic analytical techniques
Simulink model is shown in .slx file and model parameters are given in .m file.
The result data is saved in the .mat file and several figures are shown to be analyzed.

The model consist of 5 subsystems:
The Irobot Inverse subsystem
Non-Dimensional Torques subsystem
Auxiliary Control subsystem
Demand subsystem
Phased input subsystem
